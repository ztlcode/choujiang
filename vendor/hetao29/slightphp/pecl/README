TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="slightphp.[so|dll]"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("slightphp.[so|dll]");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded("slightphp"))
    echo "slightphp loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
